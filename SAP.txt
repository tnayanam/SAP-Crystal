1. SUM - the column or any manipulation on AGGREGATE: 

If you want to sum the columns then right click on that column and then click on insert and then you will find "Summary" there you can add it.

2. SORT- If you want to sort by a particular column all the records then best way is to create a group by related to that column and delete the header as you just want the data 
to be sorted you do not actually want the data to be grouped individually. One grouping is done then right click on that section and then click on Supress and it will make
sure that grouping does not take up any space. 

3. SORT - Go to record sort expert and use it.

4. Group - Positive data and Negative data Grouping:
Now in this case suppose you have a balance column and you want to group + and - amounts together. then there is no easy way to do it. So we can create a formula and then we would have to do sorting based on that.
So baiscally we will assign some sort of indicator to + balances and another indicator to -ve balances. Once that is done we can use that indicator to group by.

Formula:Name: @LessThan =  If {rptTenant.decBalance} < 0 Then 1 else 0
Now we will group the records of group by @LessThan
Also now we would like to total the groups and also the grand total in the end. Ideally this is taken care automatically. if you use step 1 of this document. But suppose you want different texts in the
report for the sum of different groups then you can follow like below.
Add a NEW FOrmula for displaying labels and add it just near the summation field in report where sum is getting caculated.
Formula: Name: @Label = If {@LessThan} = 1 then "Total Credit Balance" Else "Accounts Receivable"
Output

-20
-30
 Accounts Receivable = -50
 20
 40
 Total Credit Balance = 60
5. Only One Entry from One to many tables Inner Join- Suppose you have a one to many relationship table like below:

rptTenant 
idTenant firstName
1          Akash
2          Syrasoft

tblFitran
idFitran   idTenant   Amount
1            1          12300
2            1           458
3            2          415
4            2          1257

Select * from rptTenant inner join tblFitran on rptTenant.idTenant = tblFitran.idTenant;

Now this will result in like below ##

rptTenant 
idTenant firstName idFitran    Amount
1          Akash    1           12300
1          Akash    2           458
2          Syrasoft 3           415
2          Syrasoft 4           1257

but in reoport they only want to see one column per tenant with max amount. Expected output:

rptTenant 
idTenant firstName idFitran    Amount
1          Akash    1           12300
2          Syrasoft 4           1257

So best way is create a subreport for displaying the data of tblFitran.
Once you do that you will still save same output ##
Now in the subreport Supress all the columns there. and in the detail section add Max of (Amount)
so now in subreport only max of amount will be shown pertaining to every rptTenant

6. Keep fields together:
If you want to keep fields together then just right click and add a text field. And in that drag the columns you want to keep together.
